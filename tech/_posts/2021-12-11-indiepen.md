While documenting the
[technical details of the "Moving poetry" project]({% link tech/_posts/2021-12-01-moving-poetry.md %})
I needed to include structured code examples that would also be rendered to show the described results.
Many hosted alternatives exist,
like [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) and [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/),
but I wanted to host the files myself (to be able to version them same as the rest of this blog, etc.),
and not have to sign up for yet another service.

That's when I stumbled upon [Indiepen](https://indiepen.tech/), which judging by its description
sounded like the perfect fit:
> An independent and privacy-friendly solution to present your code examples to the people.

After a quick look I found it to have a nice responsive design that looks great,
and the
[privacy-friendliness](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/cookieless-alternative-embed-html-css-js-code-examples/)
is definitely something I'm all for!

To use Indiepen, you simply need to host the code example files (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) somewhere
and provide the URL for Indiepen to present them together with a preview.
Only one problem: Indiepen is yet another hosted service that would introduce a dependency
as described in this [Github issue](https://github.com/yetanother-blog/indiepen/issues/73).

Since Indiepen is open source with a permissive MIT license I decided to see if I could
make a build of it that could be self-hosted on this blog.
What I ended up with was something even better: a self-contained single HTML file that can be hosted and included anywhere,
removing the need to host the full web service of Indiepen.

The necessary changes to build such a file are described
[here](https://github.com/yetanother-blog/indiepen/issues/73#issuecomment-970080949),
and the setup for this blog now includes a copy of the
[Indiepen HTML file](https://github.com/zamzterz/zamzterz.github.io/blob/ac43caa9d88c51128ce8fcc4e03685535fe12765/code-examples/index.html).
For example in the ["Moving poetry" post]({% link tech/_posts/2021-12-01-moving-poetry.md %}#opacity):

```html
<iframe src="/code-examples/index.html?url=/code-examples/2021-12-01-moving-poetry/opacity/basic" loading="lazy" width="100%" height="250"></iframe>
```

which renders as 
<iframe src="/code-examples/index.html?url=/code-examples/2021-12-01-moving-poetry/opacity/basic" loading="lazy" width="100%" height="250"></iframe>
