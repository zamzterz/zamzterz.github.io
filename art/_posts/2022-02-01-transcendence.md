*Who and what are you when seen and rendered by a machine?*

Machines can be trained to see, at least in the sense that they can detect objects in images and classify them.
A behavior not very unlike the very human reaction of instinctively assigning rigid labels to everything we sense.
And despite their crudeness (which often recreates prevalent prejudices and biases),
this "machine vision", if you will, can provide a perspective on the self through the mechanical processing of data.
But what truth can lie in such simplistic classifications from a machine?

*["Transcendence: A Visionary Truth"](/art/transcendence)
is an illustrated text piece exploring and reflecting on what data can be extracted from a digitally documented transition process.
It also shows the empowering possibilities of recreating your perceived persona through technology —
using synthesized speech and animation — freeing the self from body and language.*
