        <h1>Transcendence: A Visionary Truth</h1>

        <section>
            <p>
                I went searching for answers to <br>
                the age-old question of who <br>
                am I? What I found
            </p>

            <p>
                was who I was before <br>
                the blind eyes of a machine, <br>
                a more humane vision.
            </p>

            <p>
                Revealed through time <br>
                travelled through time <br>
                judged by time,
            </p>

            <p>
                a version of myself <br>
                whose history the machine told <br>
                without words.
            </p>
        </section>

        <h2>How the machine sees me</h2>

        <p>As a set of landmarks</p>
        <div>
            <img src="data/face_landmarks.png">
        </div>

        <p>— that can be classified</p>
        <div class="chart-container">
            <canvas id="genderChart"></canvas>
        </div>

        <p>with some probability —</p>
        <div class="chart-container">
            <canvas id="genderProbabilityChart"></canvas>
        </div>

        <p>and waves that can be captured.</p>
        <div class="chart-container-big">
            <canvas id="voiceChart"></canvas>
        </div>

        <section>
            <p>
                Yet, the story my body tells <br>
                is not really true. <br>
                And that is true <br>
                whether it's human or machine <br>
                watching me.
            </p>

            <p>
                For every moment <br>
                it can be easily classified <br>
                there is another moment <br>
                of transcendence.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking back <br>
                <span class="small">at the machine computing "me"</span><br>
                I don't think <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — <i>it thinks</i> <br>
                the machine is wrong <br>
                but there's 26% of me <br>
                that might disagree.

                With the voice of any man <br>
                it says it better than I can:
            </p>

            <audio-player src="data/not_my_voice.mp3"></audio-player>
            <p class="x-small">Audio produced via speech synthesis.</p>

            <p><i>
                This is not my voice, <br>
                but these are my words.
            </i></p>

            <p><i>
                Can you hear them more true <br>
                when spoken to you <br>
                from the shallow depth <br>
                of a lifeless speaker, <br>
            </i></p>

            <p><i>
                these words that tell you who I am <br>
                more than my voice ever can.
            </i></p>
            <p><i>
                    This is not my voice. <br>
                    This is not my voice. <br>

                Now this <del>exploited</del> <ins>explored</ins> body <br>
                of data is <span class="small">not</span> all there is <br>

            <p>
                The machine's abstraction <br>
                stripping my flesh of humanity <br>
                powers my refusal to obey <br>
                my fear of being identified <br>
                as something unidentifiable, <br>
                frees me from being <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                a site for the unwanted <br>
                interpretations, <br>
                (re)creates my expression.
